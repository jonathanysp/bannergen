# Banner Course Generator

## How it works
Using a simple markov chain generator and data scraped from banner, we can generate pretty good course titles and acceptable course descriptions

## Course Data
Scraped from courses.brown.edu. I wrote my own scraper `download.js` which will download course information. Simply run `node download.js`.
